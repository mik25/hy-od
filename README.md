How it works
The addon searches for streams by querying two open directory websites, FilePursuit and Palined, based on the name of the movie or TV show. The results are then provided as streams that can be played within Stremio.

Note that the use of open directories to stream copyrighted content may be illegal in some jurisdictions. Use this addon at your own risk.
